    Usually, this hijab is designed with flower design, that is with this kind of design it can add more beauty to every woman who wears it.
    T.Silk started growing in 2010. Moreover, in the beginning, T.Silk has only one size which is named as the Standard Size (90cm x 90cm).
    Standard size is sold in store at BND 28.00. Due to the great response to this product, I have officially opened another size of T.Silk scarf (110cm x 110cm) for the needs of Muslimah women out there.
        This big size (110cm x 110cm) is sold in store at BND 30.00. Furthermore, according to the time circulation, I poured my idea to create a new style hijab using the same brand that is T.Silk Shawl, where this Shawl is sold in store at BND 35.00.
    As already known the percentage of teenagers in using shawls today is about 75%. Therefore, with this new hijab style (shawl), it can naturally attract the attention of women/teenagers out there to use hijab whenever they need.</span><br style="color: #000066" />

        <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: center; color: #000066;">Lastly, if this T.Silk Shawl gives a lot of welcome from people, I intend to introduce another new style hijab using the same brand that is T.Silk Special Scarf. Why it is called as Special Scarf? That is because I&#39;m giving the fans of T.Silk Scarves an opportunity to design their own scarves as they want.</p>
